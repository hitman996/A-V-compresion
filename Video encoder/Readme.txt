The encoder.py program captures only the Y component of the video and compresses it then dump it into a .txt file to make file size comparison at the end. 
The decoder.py uses these .txt files to get the video back to have a look at the achieved video quality at that compression level. 
Project interpreter: python2.7

step 1.  Run encoder.py 
step 2. Look at the results print in the console. 
step 3. Run decoder.py 
step 4. Observe the video quality of the video.
